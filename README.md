Hello all,  
my repos are available for you to download, use and modify as you like.

Some are applications that run on Linux servers, others are config setups I use and some are just little experiments.  
Also, I've programmed a small [website](https://felix-khlmnn.github.io) to present the repos in a different way.

Thanks for reading.
