Hello all,  
I'm a technical computer engineering student, currently I'm in the second semester of my studies.  

I'm interested in projects and technologies involving 
* Embedded Linux and real-time applications
  * Specifically the Yocto Project
* Containerization and orchestration of services
* Infrastructure automation
* Smaller projects involving Node.js and Python

This list is nothing but a brief and unordered excerpt of things that I do at work, in my free time and in the university :)
